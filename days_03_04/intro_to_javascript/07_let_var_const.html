      /*
      In JavaScript the keyword that you attach to a variable denotes its behavior and scope in your program. Here's a quick rundown of how this works - note that we will revisit this as we progress through the class as there are some nuances here that won't make sense until we get into more advanced JavaScript techniques.

      The var keyword scopes a variable to a function. This means that the variable is available within the most recently open function (curly braces). If the variable is not defined inside of a function (i.e. it's just inside of a script tag) it will be considered globally scoped. This is more or less how languages like Python treat their variables. For example:
      */

      var a = "outside";

      function doSomething() {
        var b = "function";

        console.log("a:", a);   // outside
        console.log("b:", b);   // function

        if (true) {
          var c = "ifstatement";
          console.log("a", a);  // outside
          console.log("b", b);  // function
          console.log("c", c);  // ifstatement
        }

        console.log("c", c);  // ifstatement
      }

      doSomething();

      /*
      The let keyword, however, scopes variables to a block (an set of curly braces). If the variable is not defined inside of a function (i.e. it's just inside of a script tag) it will be considered globally scoped. This is more or less how languages like Java treat their variables. For example:
      */

      let a2 = "outside";

      function doSomething2() {
        let b2 = "function";

        console.log("a2:", a2);   // outside
        console.log("b2:", b2);   // function

        if (true) {
          let c2 = "ifstatement";
          console.log("a2", a2);  // outside
          console.log("b2", b2);  // function
          console.log("c2", c2);  // ifstatement
        }

        console.log("c2", c2);  // ReferenceError: c is not defined
      }

      console.log("b2", b2);  // ReferenceError: b is not defined

      doSomething2();

      /*
      The const keyword works exactly like the let keyword (block scoped) but with one major difference - const variables cannot be changed once they have been assigned a value. They are considered 'read-only' bindings.
      This means that the binding cannot be re-assigned, thus making immutable objects 'read-only'

      With const, the binding is constant, but the value it references can be mutable if it's an object, like an array or an object literal. What const ensures is that you cannot reassign the variable to point to a different array or a different value altogether.
      */

      const a3 = "outside";
      a3 = "pikachu!";		// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

      const a4 = [10,20,30];
      a4[0] = 999; // valid!
      console.log(a4)

      // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
      a4 = [300,400,500] // invalid - binding cannot change to a new array
